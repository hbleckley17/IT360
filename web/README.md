### ** USAGE
##### Submitting a Weekend Plan:
In order to submit a weekend plan, the user must fill out the fields provided in the form
(after clicking ‘Add Weekend Plan’ in the navigation bar). If a buddy has already 
submitted a weekend plan that the users will have in common, the user can enter the 
Weekend ID (WID) provided to his/her buddy upon submission of the form. If a WID is 
provided, the user should leave the address and description blank. If no WID is provided,
a user must provide an address and description. The address field can be filled with 
"Sponsors" if the user is going to their approved sponsor address registered with the 
sponsor program and in their user profile. Regardless, a buddy’s name and phone number 
must be entered into the form.

Additionally, a user can submit a weekend plan for another friend for ease of use. All 
they need to do is provide the alpha of the friend and follow the same instructions as 
above.

##### Checking Your Weekend Plan Status:
After clicking on ‘Check Weekend Status’ in the navigation bar, a user can check the 
current status of his/her weekend plan. The table will include all the pertinent 
information to his/her submitted weekend plans and whether or not the user’s final plan
has been approved. If the user’s information was inputted incorrectly, he/she can click
on the corresponding red ‘X’ to delete that plan.

However, only one plan can be submitted for final approval at a time. If the user has 
more than one submitted plan (e.g. a friend entered a plan for another midshipmen without
knowing they had already submitted one), the user must delete unwanted plans one-by-one.

##### Dealing With Incentives:
Sometimes midshipmen are provided weekend incentives for a variety of reasons (such as 
attending a sporting event, performing well academically, etc). If a midshipman wants to
use an incentive on a certain weekend, they can associate an existing incentive with 
his/her submitted weekend plan.

To create an incentive the user should first click on ‘Create Incentives’ in the 
navigation bar. Next, the user will fill out the fields and click ‘Submit’.

After hitting ‘Submit,’ the user can see the incentive they just created in the table at
the bottom of the webpage. Next, the user can give the incentive to a certain midshipman
by filling out their respective alpha and the corresponding Incentive ID, and clicking 
‘Submit’ afterwards.

Any midshipman can view his/her current incentives by clicking on ‘Check Incentives’ in 
the navigation bar. The user should take note of the Incentive ID if he/she plans on 
adding to his/her weekend plan.

In order to associate a specific incentive with his/her weekend plan, a midshipman must
visit the ‘Add Incentives’ page. From there, the midshipmen will enter the WID and 
Incentive ID that they have noted previously. The incentive will now show up in the 
‘Check Weekend Status’ table!

##### Updating Your Profile:
After clicking on ‘Update Profile’ a user can update his/her password, company, cell 
phone number, and/or sponsor’s address. All the user needs to do is fill out each of the
form fields and click ‘Submit’!

##### Approving Weekends (ADMIN ONLY):
When the Company Officer is ready to approve/disapprove weekend plans, all they need to 
do is click on ‘Approve Weekends,’ enter his/her respective Company number, hit submit, 
check each ‘Approved’ box for the midshipmen they wish to approve, and finalize the 
approved weekend list by hitting the ‘Approve’ button below the table.

##### Adding New Users (ADMIN ONLY)
Administrators can add new users to the system by clicking on ‘Add Users’ in the 
navigation bar, enter the user’s profile information, and click ‘Submit’. All 
unregistered midshipmen can only gain access to the system by first being added by an 
administrator.
